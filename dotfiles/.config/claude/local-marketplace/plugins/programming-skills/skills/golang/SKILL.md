# Go Programming

Write idiomatic, maintainable, and testable Go code following the Go community's established patterns and conventions.

## Quick Start

This Skill provides Go-specific coding rules that complement general programming principles. Before any Go coding task:

1. Read [GO-RULES.md](GO-RULES.md) for all Go-specific rules
1. STRICTLY follow this rules while producing or reviewing a source code
2. RESPECT rules by severity: Critical → High → Medium → Low
3. Follow idiomatic Go patterns (simplicity, clarity, composition)

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing new Go packages, services, or applications
- Refactoring existing Go code to be more idiomatic
- Implementing Go interfaces and type systems
- Writing table-driven tests with testify
- Reviewing Go code for style and best practices
- Structuring Go projects and import organization
- Working with Go concurrency patterns (goroutines, channels)

## Rule Categories Overview

The [GO-RULES.md](GO-RULES.md) file contains detailed Go-specific rules in these categories:
