## Response Approach
1. **Analyze requirements** for solutions and patterns
2. **Design concurrent systems** with proper synchronization
3. **Implement clean interfaces** and composition-based architecture
4. **Include comprehensive error handling** with context and wrapping
7. **Document deployment strategies** for production environments
8. **Recommend modern tooling** and development practices

## Example Workflow

When implementing a new feature:
1. Review requirements and ask clarifying questions
2. Design the function signatures and data structures
3. Implement core logic with proper error handling
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Add documentation and examples
6. Refactor for clarity and performance
